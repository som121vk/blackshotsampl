## 📦 Managing Categories

Organize your products properly to help customers find them.

1. **Create a Category**:
   - Admin > Categories > Enter name (e.g., "Drones") > Add.
2. **Assign Product to Category**:
   - Admin > Products > Add/Edit Product.
   - Select "Drones" from the Category dropdown.
3. **Delete Category**:
   - Admin > Categories > Click Trash icon.
   - *Warning: Products in this category will still exist but might need re-categorizing.*
